## Adding Programmabilty to SQL with Templates using Python and `jinja2`    

### Accessing Materials

For the pre-populated notebook, see: [jinja_sql_demo.ipynb](jinja_sql_demo.ipynb)

Link to interactive demo via notebook binder: 
* https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/paulzuradzki/jinja_sql_demo/HEAD
* Your first time loading the notebook may take a minute as the "binder" is setting up an environment with jinja2, so you don't have to install anything locally
* Do NOT paste any sensitive data in this binder environment. 
  * A Jupyter Lab session will be launched, but it is on a separate machine for convenience and learning purposes only (note the URL does not say `localhost`).
  * You can still follow the examples and experiment with templating in the supplied environment. For real or sensitive data, you should set up an environment locally.
